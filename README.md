Task Management is a full-stack project designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It enables users to add new tasks, update the status of tasks, and remove tasks upon completion.

Features:

i. Add New Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the task list by providing details such as task name, description, deadline, etc.

ii. Update Task Status: Users can update the status of tasks, marking them as in progress, completed, or any other custom status as required.

iii. Remove Completed Tasks: Completed tasks can be removed from the task list to declutter and maintain a clear overview of pending tasks.
